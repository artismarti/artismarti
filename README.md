### Jill of all trades. Mistress of some. 👑

- 💡 I’m learning to:
  - improve my engineering skills 💻
  - improve my drawing skills 🎨
  - run a 10k 🏃🏽‍♀️
  - keep my house plants alive 🌱
- I believe that a successful team is one with a culture of _empathy_, _continuous improvement_ and _collaboration._
