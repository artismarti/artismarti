### Jill of all trades. Mistress of some. 👑

- 🔭 I’m currently working on different things at [Simply Business](https://www.simplybusiness.co.uk). (Mostly React & occasionally Rails)
- 💡 I’m currently learning to:
  - improve my engineering skills 💻
  - improve my drawing skills 🎨
  - do embroidery 🧵
  - grow a home full of plants 🌱
  - improve my score at Beat Sabre 🔼
- I believe that a successful team is one with a culture of _empathy_, _continuous improvement_ and _collaboration._
